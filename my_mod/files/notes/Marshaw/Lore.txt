_____________________________________________________________

Marshaw and its family goes to sleep after a totally normal day
But, in midnight, Marshaw wokes up, and heard a weird sound from far away
But Marshaw thought about this sound, and just ignored and got sleep.
And a new day appears, and.... wheres the everybody?

where is their mom? where is their dad? where is their sisters?
why its nobody here?

Suddenly, the whole family just dissapeared in a blink
Marshaw searched arounds, their surroundings, but nothing besides objects, food and weapons
Marshaw is alone
And they wanna your family back
